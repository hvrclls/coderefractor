For this assignment the goal was to clean up the original HTML/CSS code.
The changes that I made to the HTML/CSS code included removing redundant DIV tags and consolidating redundant CSS properties.
In addition to these changes I also added ALT tags to each image linked to the HTML.
Another change that I made was for the title to be appropriate for the web page & making sure all links are working.
